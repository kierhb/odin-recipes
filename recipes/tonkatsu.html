        <p>These breaded and fried pork cutlets make a traditional Japanese dish which is very simple and easy to make. Serve with sticky rice and tonkatsu sauce and enjoy! Also great if substituted with chicken breasts.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 (4 ounce) boneless pork chops</li>
            <li>salt and ground pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 cups oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
            <li>3/4 cup panko (Japanese-style bread crumbs)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the pork chops between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound the pork with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 1/4-inch thickness (about .75 cm). Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Pour oil into a skillet about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) deep. Heat the oil over medium-high heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place the flour, egg, and panko crumbs in separate bowls. Coat each cutlet in flour, then egg, and finally in bread crumbs. Tap off any loose crumbs.</li>
            <li>Fry the cutlets until golden brown and cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.</li>
        </ol>
